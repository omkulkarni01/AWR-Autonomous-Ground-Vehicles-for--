## Current Status of project: 
1. Done CAD model based on the calculations we have done so far for proper visualization of robotic structure.
2. Also done the simulation of the navigation part on the Robot Operating System or ROS.
3. Done with the testing of image processing codes and also trying to improve its accuracy
4. Analyze different materials which can be used to modify links and frames of the robot.
